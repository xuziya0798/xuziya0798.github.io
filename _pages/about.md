Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Statistics and Big Data, Renmin University of China. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Sai Li](https://saili0103.github.io/). I obtained my bachelor degree at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University.

   

My research interests include:

Instrumental variable methods for causal inference

Statistical inference in high-dimensional complex data

Applications in genetics and health data
